# Dataset Archive and Trimester Library

This GitHub repository contains a collection of datasets organized into an archive and a trimester library structure.

## Archive

The archive folder contains datasets that have been previously used in projects or research and are no longer actively used.

## Trimester Library (TX_YYYY)

The trimester library folder contains datasets that are currently being used or may be used in previous trimesters. The library is organized by trimesters, with each trimester representing a study period. The datasets within each trimester folder are organized by their source or category.

\*\*use the template TX_YYYY to create a new trimester library!

## Naming Convention

We use the following naming convention for the folders:

The archive folder: archive (this is all data present in this directory before the restructure)
The trimester folders: TX_YYYY, where X is the trimester number (1-3) and YYYY is the year.
The dataset folders: descriptive names that reflect the source or category of the data.

## Adding New Datasets

To add a new dataset to the library, create a new folder within the appropriate trimester folder and name it using the descriptive naming convention. Upload the data files to this new folder.

\*\*you can record new datasets in the datarecord.md inside TX_YYYY!

## Using the Datasets

To use a dataset in a project, navigate to the appropriate trimester and dataset folder and download the data files. It is recommended that you create a copy of the data files in your project directory to avoid modifying the original files in the library.

## Contributing

If you have a dataset that you would like to contribute to the library, please create a pull request with the new dataset folder added to the appropriate trimester folder.

We hope this directory is useful to you! If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please open an issue in this repository.
