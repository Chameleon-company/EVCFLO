										Here are just some of the ways your
										business can profit from EV charging.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											1. Set charging fees for customers
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										The easiest way to drive consistent
										revenue with EV charging is by setting
										charging fees. As the charging station
										owner, you can set your own fees and
										adjust them at any time. This may
										include a fixed session start or
										connection fee and a variable rate for
										the energy used. You also have the
										freedom to define your own mark-up.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>
											2. Cross-sell other products and
											services
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										When your customers stop to charge,
										there's an obvious opportunity to
										cross-sell other products and services.
										By providing your customers with a
										convenient charging experience, you also
										encourage them to browse and spend more
										on other items while they wait.
									</p>

									<p>
										<strong>
											3. Attract high-value customers
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										With EV adoption growing fast, there's
										no shortage of EV drivers looking for a
										convenient place to charge. Transforming
										your business into an EV charging
										destination allows you to capture this
										growing market and attract new
										customers. Once you have EV chargers
										installed, your location will become
										visible on popular public charging maps.
										This boosts your brand visibility
										allowing drivers to find your location.
										Plus, did you know that EV drivers are
										nearly twice as wealthy as the average
										American? This means your EV-driving
										customers will likely spend more on
										higher-end items every time they visit.
