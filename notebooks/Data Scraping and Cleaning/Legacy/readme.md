# Legacy Data Scrapping Method
These files were temporarily used to scrape data from the PlugShare website which holds a much larger number of chargers and more detail about them
than google. Unfortunately after running some time to collect data points from the Greater Melbourne area it was discovered data scrapping was being blocked.
Due to this it was decided to no longer use this method as it was unethical and we did not have permission to send so many requests to their website as it is
against their terms of service.
