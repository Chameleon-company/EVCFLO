# Archive Folder

The archive folder contains notebooks that have been previously used in projects or research and are no longer actively used.

# Trimester Library (TX_YYYY) Folder

The trimester library folder contains notebooks that are currently being used or may be used in previous trimesters. The library is organized by trimesters, with each trimester representing a study period. The notebooks within each trimester folder are organized by their source or category.

**use the template TX_YYYY to create a new trimester library!

# Data Scraping and Cleaning Folder 

Contain important information on how to collection EVCS data using Google API

# Naming Convention

We use the following naming convention for the folders:

The archive folder: archive (this is all data present in this directory before the restructure) The trimester folders: TX_YYYY, where X is the trimester number (1-3) and YYYY is the year. The dataset folders: descriptive names that reflect the source or category of the data.

# Adding New Notebook

To add a new notebook to the library, create a new folder within the appropriate trimester folder and name it using the descriptive naming convention. Upload the notebook files to this new folder.S

**you can record new datasets in the notebookrecord.md inside TX_YYYY!

# Using the Notebooks

To use a notebook in a project, navigate to the appropriate trimester and dataset folder and download the data files. It is recommended that you create a copy of the notebook files in your project directory to avoid modifying the original files in the library.

# Contributing

If you have a notebook that you would like to contribute to the library, please create a pull request with the new notebook folder added to the appropriate trimester folder.

We hope this directory is useful to you! If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please open an issue in this repository.
